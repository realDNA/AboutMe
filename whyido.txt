I had thought that making money is the much important thing in one's life. But in the recent years,
as i know more and grow in my spirit, i found that the most important thing is people actually. What is
happiness and where it come from? Making money can't bring me real happiness. Only when i help others
that i can feel truly happy. Therefore, i want to improve myself and i want to know more things to be a better 
person so that i can use my ability to make this world a better place.
