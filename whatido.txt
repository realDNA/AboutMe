I was graduated from  National Cheng Kung University and got master degree of electrical engineering
in Control Engineering field. Because i was interested in playing cameras, i joined Ability coporate
and developed cameras as a firmware and software engineer after my graduation. During this three years, i also 
studied and learned many things by myself after my work time, like building website, writing android app, building web robot,
AI application ...etc. I love and enjoy learning theses and always keep myself updated of
new technology. Specific description about what i do can refer to my projects section below.
